Portfolio Page

Still a work in progress. I still need to fill in the information for the project pages, but that's mainly an issue with the projects themselves rather than the website. Overall I feel much more comfortable working on CSS and HTML, and still getting there on Javascript. I'm happy with how it looks and how it responds, and I will keep working on it. 

Some issues I still have is slow loading times, on account of the quality of my images. I will be replacing all of them with more web suitable options. I also wanted to add smoother transitions in Javascript but couldn't figure it out. 

I did the framework and skeleton of the page very quickly, but then spent hours on relatively small things like the size of the images, their centering, and how to crop them correctly. I still haven't fully managed to handle the crops.

For my dataprojects page, I wanted to have a scrolly function with sticky labels, but that's something that will take me too long and I've already delayed posting this for long enough. I'll keep on working on it though.
